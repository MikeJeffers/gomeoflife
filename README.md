# GOme of Life
(get it?)  
Right now it will be a pretty vanilla implementation of Conway's Game of Life and largely an excuse to experiment with go concurrency patterns with embarrassingly parallel problems created in cellular automata.  In the future I might do something more interesting with different states and rulesets.  Don't get your hopes up.
